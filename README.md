## Important information
### Language specific characters
The program does not work with language specific characters, an example on these could be the Danish “æ, ø, å” so please restrain from using them.

### Commas
As well does the program does not work the commas so, please use dots instead, this is because of the way the data structure is set up and the program will save the data you input to the program wrong if there are any use of commas.
