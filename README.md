## Important information
The program does not work with language specific characters, an example on these could be the Danish “æ, ø, å” so please restrain from using them.
As well does the program does not work the commas so, please use dots instead, this is because of the way the data structure is set up and the program will save the data you input to the program wrong if there are any use of commas. 
When trying to bid on an item the program asks for the ID of the item you would like to bid on, this ID can be found under the menu “List items”, the program does not handle it well if you input anything else here then a number.
